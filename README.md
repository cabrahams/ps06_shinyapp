In this app, I was analyzing a dataset called Avg Cost of Undergrad College by State. 

In my first page, I introduce research questions I would be answering with my plot and 
table (the same ones my group and I were using for the final projects), along with the 
target audience and some basic information about the dataset. 

My plot is a bar plot with year and tutition on the 2 axis, controlled by a widget with 
3 columns. The first controls just the visuals, changing the fill of the bar plots. The 
second allows the user to select which states they would like to see data for across the 
years, and the third controls which type of school within the selected states will be 
shown data for. 

The table prints edited rows from the dataset with the total value of the tuition in each 
state. The user can select which year the data is for, as well has how many rows of the most 
and least expenasive states they would like to see displayed. 

My last page is a conclusion page that answers the research questions I introduced in the 
first page, tying the whole project together. 


I spent about 10 hours on this problem set.
